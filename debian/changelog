 -- Gordon Russell <gor@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Jul 2002 18:04:55 +0100

setserial (2.17-29) unstable; urgency=high

  * Basically after a long discussion on debian-devel, the operation of
    setserial is changed so that 
     o what was /etc/serial.conf is relocated to 
       /var/lib/setserial/autoserial.conf
     o The priority of setserial using automatic configuration information
       in init.d is altered to run after /var is mounted (S46).
     o If /etc/serial.conf exists, its configuration overrides the
       autoserial.conf permanently and utterly. It is handled at the old
       priority level of S30. Thus if priority is essential to you you
       must create a /etc/serial.conf file yourself.

    This will allow:
     o /etc to be mounted read-only
     o Policy concerning configuration files to be upheld.

    When you install this version of setserial it will detect hand-crafted
    serial information and preserve it in serial.conf, otherwise it will be
    translated into the new structures. At worst, your hand-crafted
    serial.conf file will be preserved indefinitely in 
    /var/lib/setserial/etc.serial.conf.bkp
    Do not delete this backup for any reason.

    Hope this works out for everyone. If a user had an issue with this
    setup do not file a bug without (1) reviewing the discussion on
    debian-devel, and (2) posing a workable solution in debian-devel
    which has a concensus of agreement. At worst, at least enter a
    discussion with me first before a bug report is filed.
  o For the moment I am leaving in the debconf option so that the use of
    update-modules can be disabled. I will remove this option when
    modutils handles modules.conf in a way which matches Policy. However
    Policy makes it clear that the sensible handling of modules.conf is
    down to modutils and not setserial. Thus worried people should file
    bugs with modutils concerning this specific issue.
  o In short, chaotic people can create /etc/serial.conf and that becomes
    definitive, or package-friendly people can indicate their desire to
    manage serial.conf themselves and then create /etc/serial.conf, with
    both approaches to manual serial management being equivalent. Asking
    for automatic management and then directly editing
    /var/lib/setserial/autoserial.conf is still suicide.

setserial (2.17-28) unstable; urgency=high

  * Well 2.17-27 caused me more problems than solutions, so I am going to
    backtrack from the solutions to 150514 (to use ucf) and instead force
    people to say if they want to use update-modules. If they do not, then they
    have to manage it themselves. Eventually I expect update-modules to
    offer users the ability to disable its function and to also preserve user
    modifications to that file. If users would like this functionality now,
    and they can get the update-modules maintainer to fix the problem then
    let me know and I will take the question out of setserial.

  * Templates can be processed automatically by debhelper, so the rules
    file has been changed to do that. In addition there was a small error
    in the BR template which was corrected.
    (closes: #149624)
  * Build problem on the sparc build - copying stuff into a non-existant
    directory. Careless of me... It also highlighted an error I made since
    -25, copying the serial.conf example to /usr/share/doc rather than
    /usr/share/doc/setserial. All fixed.
    (closes: #149643)
  * Upstream code depends on m68kserial.h, but this seems to be
    missing in the m68 build! Currently no updated version of setserial
    exists.

    I have made some experiments using m68k.debian.org, and at the same
    time wandered through the current kernel code for the 68k series of
    machines. It looks to me as if someone has rewritten the 68k serial
    module to make it more compatible with the non 68k approaches. In
    setserial m68k is taken care of seperately from all other systems. I
    cannot find out exactly what has changed, and without root access on
    a 68k machine I cannot verify its functionality change.

    As an interim measure, I have adjusted the way setserial compiles so
    that it will compile on the latest kernels. I am reasonably sure that
    the end result will be a poorer environment for m68k users. Unfortunately
    I can do no better than this. If a concerned m68k user or two wants to
    co-operate with me then we can see what can be done. As the bug report
    concerned the build process, the bug is therefore closed with this
    modified source. At worst I would think the modified setserial will simply
    list more UARTS as unknown...

  * I really blew 2.17-14
    Anyway, the fix is changed so that on initial bootup, the modload

    "start" causes the ports to be configured again. Hopefully this will not
    cause any serious side-effects. I have more carefully checked this fix.

  * The module.conf entries for pre-remove of modules in kerneld
    is a null operation, although previous releases of setserial makes
    use of this function, in the hope that one day it actually works.
    However, if you currently unload and then reload the serial.o module,
    you lose all your serial configuration details until you run
    /etc/init.d/setserial start
    I have made a simple change to the configuration, so that failure of
    pre-remove is detected, and the serial ports on a module reload are
    reconfigured to the configuration present imediately after serial
    configuration has completed.
    This is not as good as pre-remove actually working, but is probably
    sufficient for all but the most nit-picking people out there. If
    you change your serial configuration a lot during a single boot session,
    consider calling
    /etc/init.d/setserial modsave
    from cron every minute or two (or at least before a module autoclean
    occurs).

    to a question when you update to this setserial version. Sorry about
    that... You should find the default answer adequate. For now, I have
    set its priority to "medium". Should this be "low"?
  * Another side-effect of moving to debconf - stdout output in postrm causes
    the postrm to fail. I have removed all output to stdout and replaced it
    where necessary to stderr. Hopefully it will work a lot better now.
    Thanks to Joey Hess for giving me the fix...

setserial (2.17-10) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes by Josip Rodin:
    + Used debconf to display the warning when update-modules fails
      (thanks to Joey Hess), more properly closes: #59013, #59170.
    + Merged m68k and non-m68k postinsts into one, using a simple test,
      just like it's done in debian/config file. Updated some of the
      postinst messages.
    + Reordered debian/rules to actually install serial.conf.sparc on sparc,
      it was being rewritten by the default one.
    + Removed old comment about that RedHatoid RCLOCKFILE variable in
      init script, useless.

    Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>

  * Added a "|| true " to the db_input line Josip added to the postinst.
    This was needed to support error code 30 (already answered the question).

  * debconf update was less than perfect. This release

    obvious way of doing it.

setserial (2.17-4) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * pcmcia-cs has changed again. Apparently, bugs in serial.o in the kernel
    is breaking pcmcia, and the upstream maintainer now uses setserial to
    do some stuff to get around these bugs. However, I have patched Debian
    setserial to avoid doing things to pcmcia serial ports in order to close
    many of the pcmcia-related setserial bugs...
    I have therefore changed the way pcmcia filtering is done in setserial.
    Now, pcmcia devices are reported using -G, but the report ends with
    "pcmcia". This flag is ignored whereever it appears in a setserial
    configuration request. Thus, pcmcia devices are clearly marked, and
    are filtered out using grep in /etc/init.d/setserial.

  * Moved the serial port reporting part of /etc/init.d/setserial so
    that instead of reporting the state of all valid ports, it only
    reports the state of ports specifically mentioned in the
    /etc/serial.conf file. This is necessary as there appears to be
    a fatal error in the kernel/pcmcia-cs part of linux which means that
    reading state from a non-existant serial port results in pcmcia-cs
    being unable to use that port for pcmcia serial devices in the future...

    /var/run/setserial.conf, and this information is not preserved over
    reboots. The default is not to have AUTOSAVE in the serial.conf file,
    and instead on the first install of setserial all ports are saved once
    only. This may break the boot disks, but I hope not...

setserial (2.15-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * The bug reports are starting to back up now. Sorry for any delay.
    This release is more experimental than usual. PCMCIA users please
    investigate with a little caution. The routines which protected you
    have been removed from the control script and put into the C code.
  * The patch to make compilation on sparcs and alphas was not applied
    correctly. It was broken anyway. I have now read the manual on autoconf
    and fixed it. Hope this is better for everyone...
    (closes: #40051)
  * setserial does not check for the existence of update-modules - I use
    this in the postinst file, to support module loading and unloading from
    the kernel. Although modutils is "required", and thus I should not have
    to worry about it not being there, in truth if the serial module is
    hardwired in the kernel, then it will never be unloaded, and thus I 
    do not really need modutils. So I will agree with the bug submitter, and
    ignore its absence if that is the case.
    (closes: #40957)
  * In the postinst file for i386, I talk about saving when you "logout". I
    really ment to say "shutdown or halt your machine".
    (closes: #40993)
  * Apparently the setserial as supplied from upstream does not AUTOSAVE
    all the needed information to make a successful reload of all useful data.
    I have edited the setserial.c code to do it properly, and send the changes
    upstream.
    A moan about the size of the /etc/init.d/setserial file was present.
    Personally I don't see why it matters, but I have recoded much of the
    code in c and put it into the executable. Again I will forward the
    changes upstream. Of course, this is likely to produce even more bug
    reports...
    Please try to put only one bug in each report. This one griped about a few
    things, which makes it hard to close. However, everything else is really
    wishlist stuff so I am making the bold step of closing it anyway. If people
    are unhappy they should resubmit the bugs seperately...
    The additional problems were:
       o manual page does not contain some useful information which is only
         found in the docs - wishlist stuff, and maintaining a changed manual
         page when the upstream maintainer changes is frequently is not my
         idea of fun.
       o complaint that if root sets the wrong configuration on the serial
         ports, shutdowns and then reboots, then wrong configuration is still
         there - root is a dangerous user and I don't know what to do to make
         it safer!

setserial (2.15-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Up to now, the serial module in the kernel can be unloaded and reloaded
    by both kerneld and kmod dynamically whenever the system desires. I had
    thought that all the setserial settings made to serial ports would
    persist between unloads and reloads of the serial module. Apparently
    this is not the case, and so I have added some additions which means
    that "/etc/init.d/setserial stop" is called when the serial module is
    unloaded, and "/etc/init.d/setserial start" is called when the serial
    module is loaded. Hopefully this will solve this issue. Note however that
    if you have switched off AUTOSAVE in the serial.conf file, then the
    settings will be lost when the module is unloaded, and the settings
    stored in serial.conf will be the ones loaded into the serial module when
    it is next loaded into the kernel. Personally, serial is never unloaded
    for me as I use both gpm and X, which uses the serial module all the time.
    Thus the testing I have performed on this has been less than ideal.
    However, it should work as advertised. I wasn't sure how to log the output,
    so if someone wants to check that out and raise a report if I got it wrong
    that would be useful.

setserial (2.15-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tackled the pcmcia modem/serial card problem. The init.d script is
    now exceptionally long-winded, and does every check I can think of
    to make sure that the serial device setserial is controlling is not
    a pcmcia device. It does the following in addition to the upstream
    methods:
      (1) AUTOSAVE now does not save ports which are UART "unknown"
      (2) a serial port must be /dev/ttyS? or /dev/ttyS??
      (3) if the I/O address of a port is within an I/O window as
          reported by "cardctl config", it is not saved
      (4) if the device is listed in /var/run/stab, do not save it.
    Hopefully everything will now work as intended. People with pcmcia
    problems due to an earlier version of 2.15 will have to do some
    repairs (check out pcmcia.repair).
