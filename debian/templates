Template: setserial/autosave
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Automatically configure the serial port parameters?
 It is recommended that the serial port parameters should be
 configured automatically. It is also possible to configure them
 manually by editing the file /etc/serial.conf.
 .
 PCMCIA serial-type devices should be configured with pcmciautils. See
 /usr/share/doc/setserial/README.Debian.gz for details.

Template: setserial/autosave-types
Type: select
__Choices: autosave once, manual, autosave always, kernel
Default: autosave once
_Description: Type of automatic serial port configuration:
 Setserial allows saving the current serial configuration in various ways:
 .
  autosave once  : save only once, now;
  manual         : never save the configuration automatically;
  autosave always: save on every system shutdown (risks overwriting the
                   serial.conf file with errors);
  kernel         : do not use the serial.conf file and use the kernel settings
                   at bootup.

Template: setserial/update-modules-failed
Type: error
_Description: Error during update-modules configuration for setserial
 The setserial configuration process tried to install the module
 management code to support the serial.o module being loaded and
 unloaded dynamically by the kernel module loader.
 .
 This process failed. This may be caused by a non-standard module
 configuration and should be solved manually by running
 '/sbin/update-modules'.
